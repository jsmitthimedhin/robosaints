Source control allows people to share files... multiple people can collaborate on one document (like Google doc)


Ep. 190 : A typical Day
Trello boards
1. git checkout master (to see what the master is like or if there are changes)
2. git pull (to pull the latest branch in)
3. "Stand up" - team members involved will meet together to hear updates
4. git branch update-(whatever) to get the latest updates
-git checkout (the feature) so you can work on that specific branch
5. Once everything is fixed, do a PR (pull request) - git add, git command, and git push
6. QA (quality control) will then check the update at 3pm to see if the bug is fixed, app is working, etc. Then you merge into master

Ep. 193: NPM intro.
-NPM is Javascript code that's already done for you. We can then build on top of it.
-You can combine different code files together to broaden functionality.
-Be careful... if your size becomes too big, then the website will load slower. You can also use "Yarn" instead
**3 types of packages:
1. Packages on the frontend that you can use on the browser. (Html, css, js)
2. New commands for the commandline
3. Backend (node.js)
**3 must-know things you need to know to start a project
1. HTML, CSS, JS (frontend)
2. Github Repo + Git (source control)
3. Packages that other people have writen (package.json)

Ep. 194 NPM Install
-If you want to run as administrator, just type "sudo" in the command line before the command and it'll ask you to log-in
*What is .json? It's a file format -- similar to javascript but has double quotes for property

Ep. 194 Installing and Using Packages
if it's locally, it will give you new abilities in the js file.



Ep. 197 Installing and Using Packages
Dev Dependencies - Code that develpers use that won't show up on the front end (will explain more once we get to the React section)

Ep. 208 Your First React Component
-The index.js file has imports from react to ensure that the packages use files from React
-In react, ./ means it's in the same directory (so, for instance, importing './index.css' means importing the css file from the same folder)

**What the heck is "service worker?" -- it's a way for the app to run faster...
